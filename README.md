# CIFAR-10 Object Classification!

This is Deep Learning project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 distinct categories.

## Overview

The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is a widely used benchmark in image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, making it an ideal dataset for testing and training image classification models.

## Features

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture optimized for image classification.
- Trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 10 distinct classes.
- Evaluation of model performance using various classification metrics.
- Potential for further improvements and experimentation with Hyperparameters tuning.

## Technologies Used:

- Python3.10

- TensorFlow

- Computer Vision

- CNN
